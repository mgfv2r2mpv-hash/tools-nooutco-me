      <Section title="SDA vs. FBA vs. ABC data collection">
        <p>A <strong>Systematic Descriptive Assessment (SDA)</strong> is an observational procedure; the assessor does not manipulate antecedents or consequences. This contrasts with an experimental functional analysis (FA/EFA), which involves controlled condition comparisons with programmed contingencies.</p>
        <p>Compared to traditional narrative ABC data, SDA introduces <strong>structure and quantification</strong>: partial interval recording across fixed time windows, with all four possible consequence types recorded simultaneously in every interval. This eliminates the observer-selection bias inherent in event-based ABC, where the observer typically records only consequences they deem relevant.</p>
        <p>The result is a complete co-occurrence record that can be analyzed probabilistically, enabling a transition from subjective narrative to empirical conditional probabilities.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Interview-informed assessment (IISCA rationale)">
        <p>Rather than starting from a blank hypothesis, this tool supports an <strong>interview-informed</strong> approach (Hanley et al., 2014). Informed by an open-ended functional assessment interview (e.g., IISCA), the assessor identifies the most likely reinforcers <em>before</em> observation begins and flags them as &quot;indicated functions&quot; in the session setup.</p>
        <p>These indicated consequences appear on the <strong>left</strong> side of each interval row, enabling faster scoring during live observation; they are also reflected in the output so reviewers understand the assessor&apos;s a priori hypothesis.</p>
        <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">

        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="EO contriving and condition density">
        <p>The <strong>Establishing Operation (EO)</strong> is the motivating condition that temporarily increases the value of a reinforcer and evokes behavior maintained by that reinforcer. Examples: attention deprivation (attention EO), prolonged demands (escape EO), denial of preferred item (tangible EO), unoccupied/alone time (sensory EO).</p>
        <p>In a <em>naturalistic</em> SDA, EOs are not contrived; you record their natural presence or absence. In a <em>semi-structured</em> SDA, the environment may be arranged to alternately produce EO-present and EO-absent epochs, increasing the probability of observing both states within a practical observation period.</p>
        <p><strong>Block density matters:</strong> If nearly all intervals have the EO present, P(Bx|A−) is based on a very small denominator and the Antecedent CV estimate will be unreliable. Aim for at least 20–25% EO-absent intervals for each condition when possible. The raw cell counts table on the Review screen helps you audit this before analysis.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Interval length considerations">
        <p>Partial interval recording <strong>overestimates</strong> behavior rate relative to its true base rate; any occurrence in the interval, regardless of duration, counts. Longer intervals amplify this effect.</p>
        <p>For <strong>conditional probability analysis</strong>, interval length also affects co-occurrence detection: a 10-second interval captures more temporal proximity than a 5-second interval but introduces more noise around event boundaries. Literature recommendations (Vollmer et al., 2001; Camp et al., 2009) were developed around 10-second intervals in clinic settings. For longer intervals (15s+), each interval already spans a wider time window, so the Lag-1 correction can over-credit events in adjacent intervals; consider turning it off in those cases.</p>
        <p>Very short intervals (≤5s) may produce ceiling effects (high Bx+ rates regardless of condition), reducing CV sensitivity. A common practical choice is <strong>10s</strong> for clinic settings and <strong>15s</strong> for classroom or community contexts.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Synthesized condition procedure">
        <p>A <strong>synthesized condition</strong> presents multiple EOs simultaneously; the assessor selects which conditions are active at the same time. This mirrors the real environment, where multiple motivating operations often co-occur (e.g., a child is placed in a demand context with limited adult attention and no preferred items).</p>
        <p>Because all selected EOs are present in every interval, there is a <strong>single merged EO column</strong> in the data entry screen; you score whether the combined EO context is present or absent, rather than scoring each EO individually. Consequences are still scored separately for all four functions.</p>
        <p>Synthesized conditions are analyzed independently in the output, not pooled with separate conditions. Multiple synthesized runs are supported (e.g., run 1 with Attention + Escape; run 2 adding Tangible).</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Lag-1 correction: mathematical basis">
        <p>Standard same-interval co-occurrence requires behavior and the antecedent or consequence to fall in the <em>same</em> interval n. This underestimates true associations when events straddle interval boundaries.</p>
        <p><strong>Antecedent Lag-1:</strong> An EO recorded in interval n−1 is treated as present in interval n. Formally:</p>
        <code className="block bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded p-2 text-xs my-1 font-mono">
          EO_effective[n] = EO[n] OR EO[n−1]
        </code>
        <p>This reduces false negatives when the motivating operation immediately precedes the behavior interval.</p>
        <p><strong>Consequence Lag-1:</strong> A consequence recorded in interval n+1 is credited to behavior in interval n. Formally:</p>
        <code className="block bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded p-2 text-xs my-1 font-mono">
          C_effective[n] = C[n] OR C[n+1]
        </code>
        <p>This accounts for natural delays in consequence delivery (e.g., a teacher notices and provides attention one interval after the behavior occurred).</p>
        <p>In the Excel export, Lag-1 is implemented via hidden helper columns that COUNTIFS references, keeping the visible formulas clean. On the analysis screen, you can toggle each independently.</p>

        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Interpreting CV and ACV">
        <p>The <strong>Contingency Value (CV)</strong> is the difference in conditional probabilities:</p>
        <code className="block bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded p-2 text-xs my-1 font-mono">
          CV = P(Bx | C+) − P(Bx | C−)
        </code>
        <p>The <strong>Antecedent CV (ACV)</strong> is the analogous measure for EO presence:</p>
        <code className="block bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded p-2 text-xs my-1 font-mono">
          ACV = P(Bx | A+) − P(Bx | A−)
        </code>
        <p>Both range from −1 to +1. A positive value indicates that behavior is more likely when the relevant condition is present. Interpretation requires considering raw cell counts (especially denominator sizes), the number of intervals collected, and the overall base rate of behavior; clinical judgment is essential.</p>
        <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">

        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Observation time and accountability">
        <p>The timer in the data entry screen tracks active observation time per session. This is summed across all conditions on the analysis screen and included in output files when available.</p>
        <p>Observation time matters for two reasons: (1) it anchors behavior rate (responses per minute), giving a meaningful metric for comparing conditions; and (2) it provides accountability. An assessment with only 5 minutes of observation across conditions yields conditional probability estimates with very wide margins of uncertainty compared to a 30-minute assessment. More intervals and longer observation windows produce more reliable estimates.</p>

          <li>Start the timer <em>before</em> your first interval. The pace indicator shifts automatically so you always know which interval to be completing.</li>
          <li>If you miss an interval, leave it as Could Not Score (default) and keep pace; do not go back and fill it in retrospectively.</li>
          <li>For faster scoring, pre-assign indicated functions during session setup; they appear on the left, closest to your thumb on a touchscreen or to Tab-stop order on a keyboard.</li>
          <li>Use the note button (pencil icon) sparingly during live scoring. Mark the interval and add context notes afterward during the Review screen.</li>
          <li>If you need to pause, stop the timer. The accumulated time persists when you resume.</li>
          <li>The &quot;Saved ✓&quot; indicator confirms each change is written to localStorage. No manual save is required.</li>
